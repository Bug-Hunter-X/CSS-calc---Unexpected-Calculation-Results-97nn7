The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that's not a valid CSS unit (e.g., a negative width or height, or a value that contains an unexpected character), it can lead to unexpected layout issues or rendering problems.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 200px);` works fine if the containing element is wider than 200px, but if it's not, the width becomes zero or negative, causing the element to collapse or be hidden.  Similarly, typos or incorrect operators can easily break the calculation.
